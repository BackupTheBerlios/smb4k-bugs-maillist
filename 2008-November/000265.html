<PRE>OK, now that I'm a subscriber to the mailing list, I'm sending this request 
again... sorry about that.  I wasn't sure if it would have been approved for 
the mailing list since I wasn't a subscriber.  Here it is:


Hi, I'm extremely new to Linux.  I I have a laptop and got rid of Windows and 
am now running Mandriva.  The laptop is on the internet wirelessly through a 
home network.  There is a desktop computer on this network that is 
connected to the router by ethernet connecter.  This desktop has an 
external hard drive connected to it that I must be able to connect to 
wirelessly.  The workgroup is called &quot;MSHOME&quot;.  The desktop is called 
&quot;FAMILY&quot; and the external drive is simply called &quot;G&quot;

I successfully found and mounted to this G drive with smb4k.  But 
something happened and I lost the G drive where I can no longer see its 
contents.  I can still see the contents of G when I go into Mandriva's Dolphin 
File Manager and look under Samba Shares.  As soon as this happened I 
tried opening smb4k to see what happened to the mount, but it would not 
open.  It has not opened since then.  I can see that it tries to open, but it 
fails and the program shuts down before it ever opens.  When I look in the 
System Monitor, I see that smb4k is still trying to run and that it is taking 
50% of the cpu.  Still, it never actually opens up.

Since this was a fresh install of Mandriva and I hadn't gotten far in using 
it, I just decided to reinstall and try it all again.  I formatted partitions, 
reinstalled Mandriva, and tried smb4k again... and the exact same results 
happened.

What can I do to fix this and get my external drive mounted?  Like I said, I'm 
very new to Linux and I am trying to do as much as I can with programs 
because I do not know anything about using the terminal to mount anything.  
I would appreciate any help in this matter.

Thanks.

</PRE>
