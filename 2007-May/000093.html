<PRE>Bug #10126, was updated on 2007-Jan-26 07:34
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Smb4K
Category: None
Status: Closed
Resolution: None
Bug Group: normal
Priority: 5
Submitted by: marsolin
Assigned to : none
Summary: A share appears to mount and then immediately disappears

Details: I'm running Kubuntu Edgy. When I use Smb4K I can browser the network and preview shares correctly, but noe of the mounting methods work.

It looks like the share is starting and then disconnects on its own. It even appears for a moment in the right side of the window. The directory for the share gets created, but it is empty.

I also tried CIFS, but with no luck.

Thanks.  I looked and I'm using 0.7.1 from the Ubuntu repos.

You can close the issue now.

The problem of a messed up sudoers file has been fixed in version 0.7.5, so please upgrade. Ubuntu packages of version 0.8.0 can be downloaded from our FTP site. Add the following lines to your /etc/apt/sudoers:

deb <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smb4k/ubuntu/edgy/">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smb4k/ubuntu/edgy/</A> ./
deb-src <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smb4k/ubuntu/edgy/">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smb4k/ubuntu/edgy/</A> ./

The packages are not official ones but are packaged by me, so bugs should be reported to the Smb4K-general mailing list: <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/smb4k-general">https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/smb4k-general</A>

Looking at you error message reminded me that you must not set the SUID root bit for smbmount, but for smbmnt. Sorry, my mistake. To revert the change and set the SUID root bit for smbmnt just do

$ sudo chmod -s /path/to/smbmount
$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/smbmnt

What puzzles me is that Smb4K does not recognize the error message and also does not seem to write the needed lines to your sudoers file. I'll have to investigate this further. In the meantime, could you please report which locale you are using and if you have any software running (firewall, SELinux, etc.) that does not come with the default installation?

Thanks for the help. I looked in my sudoers file and didn't see anything resembling what moenchmeyer listed below. I double checked the Smb4K Super User config, and the appropriate box in Actions was checked. To confirm that it really was I unchecked it, hit Apply, then rechecked and hit Apply again. This time it did update sudoers.

Unfortunately, it also messed up the sudoers file. The following lines got added to the beginning of the file and I couldn't use sudo any more.

X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 166
  Major opcode:  145
  Minor opcode:  3
  Resource id:  0x0
Failed to open device
X Error: BadDevice, invalid or uninitialized input device 166
  Major opcode:  145
  Minor opcode:  3
  Resource id:  0x0
Failed to open device

I finally got that fixed and tried mounting a drive through Smb4K again. This time it worked. It looks like the real problem was the feature box being checked without it actually being set up. The second issue was the error that somehow got listed in the sudoers file. I'm not sure how that happenned.

Thanks for the help.

I did have the same problem as a standard user with Opensuse 10.2. 
I found that everything with CIFS worked correctly whenever I used smb4k as root. However, when trying to mount a share as a normal user (let us call him &quot;rm&quot;) I got the described error - the system first seems to mount the share, but after some seconds the share disappears from the display of the mounted cifs shares.

So I had a look at the rights which &quot;rm&quot; had for performing smb4k with sudo. I found that I had to modify the &quot;/etc/sudoers&quot; file such that the standarduser  &quot;rm&quot; is included in the group of users for which sudo (without password) is allowed in combination with the elementary commands smb4k_mount and smb4k_umount.   smb4k uses these commands (and probably /sbin/mount.cifs and/sbin/umount.cifs) in the background. 

Obviously the sudo settings in the smb4k dialog for super user privileges do not lead to the required entries in /etc/sudoers in the case of Opensuse 10.2. 

In my case the sudoer file must contain the entries 

# Entries for Smb4K users.
# Generated by Smb4K. Please do not modify!
User_Alias	SMB4KUSERS = root, rm
# sudoers file.
# User privilege specification
root	ALL = (ALL) ALL
SMB4KUSERS	rux64 =  NOPASSWD: /opt/kde3/bin/smb4k_kill
SMB4KUSERS	rux64 =  NOPASSWD: /opt/kde3/bin/smb4k_umount
SMB4KUSERS	rux64 =  NOPASSWD: /opt/kde3/bin/smb4k_mount
Defaults:SMB4KUSERS	env_keep =  &quot;PASSWD USER&quot;

rux64 is the hostname. 
The important point is the line 

User_Alias	SMB4KUSERS = root, rm 

&quot;rm&quot; must be a member of the usergroup that is allowed to perform the smb4k_... commands. 
Obviously it is no longer possible to get this entry via the smb4k configuration. 

Instead, you have to edit the sudoer file manually or in case of  Opensuse by the sudo-maintenance program you find in YAST -&gt; security and users.  

Kind regards

I ran the following command.

$ smbmount //chad-placer-x/Backup /home/chad/Shares/Backup

It asked for my password, I entered it, and these errors were returned.

smbmnt must be installed suid root for direct user mounts (1000,1000)
smbmnt failed: 1

Next I tried the chmod commands that were suggested and this error occurred.

libsmb based programs must *NOT* be setuid root.
8109: Connection to chad-placer-x failed
SMB connection failed

Adding sudo to the mount command worked.  I was able to unmount successfully from the commandline as well. Unfortunately my problem in Smb4K still exists.

$ sudo smbmount //chad-placer-x/Backup /home/chad/Shares/Backup

sudo is selected in Smb4K's configuration. It's almost as if the drive is being mounted, and then immediately being unmounted.  Can you think of a reason for that?

IMPORTANT: Please do the mounting/unmounting tests *before* you set the SUID root bit. Else the mounting/unmounting will succeed and you won't get the error messages.

Comment:
To fix this problem, you need to either set the SUID root bit for smbmount/smbumount/mount.cifs/umount.cifs

$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/smbmount
$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/smbumount
$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/mount.cifs
$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/umount.cifs

or enable the super/sudo support in the configuration dialog (Super User -&gt; Actions -&gt; Use super user privileges to mount and unmount shares).

Normally, Smb4K should automatically inform you about this. That it didn't seems to indicate that the error message that's returned by the mount process is different from the ones Smb4K knows. So, would you please do me a favor and try to mount a share from the shell using the following commands:

$ smbmount //HOST/SHARE /mount/point
$ mount.cifs //HOST/SHARE /mount/point

Please replace HOST and SHARE with the appropriate values and choose an existing mount point. Both commands should fail and return an error message. Please report both here. Additionally, I want to ask you to also report the error messages that are returned by smbumount and umount.cifs if you try to unmount a share:

$ smbumount /mount/point
$ umount.cifs /mount/point
