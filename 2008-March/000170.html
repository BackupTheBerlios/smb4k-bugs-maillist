Summary: SMB4K hangs on starting automatically with KDE

Details: Sometimes after starting KDE with automatically launching smb4k as it run in the last session, smb4k hangs. Its icon in the system tray does not occur,there is a gray space instead of that. I f I do a 'killall smb4k' and restart smb4k again all goes fine.

Comment:
Well, no good news from me: the problem discussed within this thread did not occur to this time, but using the v0.9.4pre (compiled locally from your source package as RPM package) my system freezes after a while using smb4k totally. X-Server is dead, only hard switch-off helps, and the last entry in /var/log/messages is something like:

Are there any other logs to look into?

Thanks, I have it. Unfortunately it will take me a couple of days or weeks to be as sure as possible, since this problem occured only rarely. I'll tell you results as soon as I will have some.

I uploaded a snapshot to our FTP site. You'll find it here:

Sorry, I was out of office the last few days.
Yes, I can test it. I cannot access CVS from within the company network here, would you be so kind to send me a source package of the snapshot you mentioned?
Thank you

Comment:
I applied some modifications to the mounter (and other core classes) and I think I could eliminate the problem you reported. The changes are currently in CVS (branch: BRANCH_0_9). Would you be willing to test it? (I can prepare a source package for you if you like.)

Comment:
Smb4K waits until the requested wallet is open before it reads the authentication information and proceeds with mounting the shares. That's why this bugs is sort of weird. Also, I cannot reproduce it. My settings are similar to yours and I regularly launch Smb4K on KDE start mounting several shares automatically. There are no problems whatsoever (My wallet is password protected and I provide the passphrase immediately when the dialog pops up.). However, I'm using Debian and haven't tried the same with OpenSUSE yet. I'll do it this weekend.

Renewal of information: The problem still occurs (not often, but it happens) even in v0.9.2, even though I made my KWalletManager starting automatically (by an empty KWallet password). May be there is some &quot;race&quot; between KWalletManager and Smb4K which sometimes Smb4K wins and does not get the share's login information. Isn't it Smb4K which shoul wait for KWalletManager some time to provide its information?
At the moment using:
smb4k 0.9.2 3.5.8 &quot;release 44.1&quot;, openSUSE
kwalletmanager 1.1
OS: Linux (i686) release 2.6.22.16-0.2-default
Target: i586-suse-linux

Comment:
Hi dustpuppy: The answer to Your first question is: Yes, the problem definitely occurs in v0.9.0, too.
I think this is really a problem of not entering a kwalletmanager passphrase &quot;in time&quot; (whatever &quot;in time means&quot;). Smb4k hangs in some deadlock, even if I enter the right passphrase later, while other kwallet applications work.
Please let me know, if I can help You somehow to locate it (gathering a stacktrace or something similar).

Comment:
One thing I got to add: I think the problem discussed here occurs in conjunction with the usage of kwalletmanager, when I do not immediately enter my passphrase to open the according wallet for smb4k, but leave it several minutes closed. Is that possible?

Comment:
Today I got the new upstream version smb4k-0.9.0 from Packman for OpenSUSE 10.3. I will watch this for a while to get sure.

Comment:
Does this problem also occur with version 0.9.0?

Comment:
Another fact which might help to reproduce it:

I have a couple of bookmarks saved which are mounted automatically each time smb4k starts. These shares belong to one and the same computer (cifs, using a Windows domain for authenticating)

Some settings possibly different from defaults:
Network:
Browse List - Query the current workgroup master browser
Network Search - Use nmblookup (recommended)
Shares:
- Unmount all shares of user ... on exit
- Remount recebtly used shares on program start
- Allow the unmounting of shares that are owned by other users
Authentication:
- Save login information in a wallet
- If no wallet is used, remember passwords during runtime
Samba:
NetBIOS name: set to one
Domain (workgroup): set to one
Super user:
- Use sudo
- Use super user privileges to force the unmounting of broken shares
- Use super user privileges to mount and unmount shares
