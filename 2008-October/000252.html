<PRE>Bug #14703, was updated on 2008-Oct-20 10:56
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Smb4K
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: normal
Priority: 5
Submitted by: arkascha
Assigned to : none
Summary: Hang during KDE start, starts ok afterwards

Details: Our old bug about smb4k hanging during session startup when starting along with kde is back :-)

I upgraded to smb4k-0.9.8-3.1 under opsneuse-10.2 @ x86-64. 
smb4k is started with the kde startup via the kde session configuration. I get an empty space in the panel where smb4k is meant to be. A hovering mouse at that point shows a &quot;busy cursor&quot; and the shares are _not_ mounted. 

If I do a  &quot;killall smb4k&quot; and restart it everything works fine. So it appears like smb4k hangs when it is started during kde startup. Probably because the ressource (kwallet??) it requires it not _yet_ present.

I modified the code of the mounter so that it waits until the application has fully started up before it tries to remount and import shares. I tested this with openSUSE 11.0 and Debian Lenny and it seems to work on KDE start-up without hanging.

Would you be willing to test the new version?

Actually, when mentioning that smb4k did hang after being woken up from hibernation I was more than unclear. I did see that, BUT: 
_usually_ I have no problems after waking up my system in the morning. Right now I COULD access the shares, amongst those one mounted by smb4k, several mounted via /etc/samba/smbfstab. After wake up I see smb4k shuffling around for a second or two and it's fine. Might be interesting to sniff its conversation with the servers, though. 
This shows once more that your app is a fine gem that comes in handy at daily work. Thanks !

So, the fix I implemented previously does not work as expected. That's bad and I have to look for another solution...

Smb4K has no support for suspend or hibernation in 0.9, so it is likely that it hangs after your system has woken up. In the next major version will support suspend and hibernation through Solid. The only way to avoid the hanging in 0.9 is to manually unmount the shares before you suspend your computer.

I can understand that you stick with KDE 3.5. It is very stable and feature-rich. KDE 4.x still lacks several applications that a user wants to have.

I have kdeutils3-3.5.10 installed, that packages provides kwalletmanager. I DO use kwallet to store passwords for smb4k. 
The wallet works ok, other applications can open and use it on system startup. 

Today I realized that smb4k also hangs when the system is being woken up from a syspend-to-disk. Same symptoms. 

I have NOT tried smb4k-0.10.x since I assume it relies on kde-4.x. I use kde-3.5.10 since I use it for daily work. No way and no interest for me to upgrade my kde.

Comment:
Is kwalletmanager installed? There are indications that your problem might occur when it isn't... 

Have you tried Smb4K 0.10.x by any chance?

This bug is really persistent and annoying... I'll have a look at this.
