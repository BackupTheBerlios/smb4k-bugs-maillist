I uploaded version 0.9.4pre3 to <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smb4k/pre-releases/smb4k-0.9.4pre3.tar.bz2.">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smb4k/pre-releases/smb4k-0.9.4pre3.tar.bz2.</A> I hope this one works.

That's embarrassing. I implemented the error handling but forgot to add the code that actually inserts the authentication information to the shell command. This has been fixed in CVS and I will prepare a new pre-release as soon as possible.

I've compiled v0.9.4pre2.

When browsing my network, I now get a popup window. I fill in the user and password, I keep get a window with access denied :-(

I prepared a pre-release for testing purposes including the fix for this bug. You'll find the tarball here: <A HREF="ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smb4k/pre-releases/smb4k-0.9.4pre2.tar.bz2.">ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/smb4k/pre-releases/smb4k-0.9.4pre2.tar.bz2.</A> Could you please test it?

Comment:
Thank you for providing this comprehensive information. With it I could pinpoint the bug. Smb4K did not test for authentication errors when querying the workgroup master browser. Hence, no password dialog was provided to enter the authentication information making it impossible to get the list of workgroup members. I corrected this issue in CVS. Smb4K 0.9.4 will include the fix.

Since you get an error when you attempt to open the configuration dialog, I guess you have compiled Smb4K from source and installed it into a custom directory. Have you added this custom directory to the KDEDIRS environment variable? For Smb4K development I use the same approach and the respective entries in my ~/.bashrc read like this:

export KDEDIR=/usr
export KDEDIRS=$HOME/local:$KDEDIR
export QTDIR=/usr

($HOME/local is my custom directory.)

Under OpenSUSE you need sudo support switched on for mounting. To get it working, you first need to get the configuration dialog working. Then go to the &quot;Administrator&quot; configuration page and tick at least the last option under &quot;Actions&quot;. Smb4K will now modify your /etc/sudoers file to set up sudo support. But beware: Since the /etc/sudoers configuration file contains one very long line under OpenSUSE, you will run into a bug of kdesu (I already reported it upstream.) that inserts a line break into it. You need to fix it before you can work with sudo again.

</I>&gt;<i> When I said Samba 3.0.28 would fix the problem, I was referring to the client, not the server. I don't know if it matters which version is installed on the server (your synology disk). Is it possible to upgrade the Samba version to 3.0.28 on your computer?
</I>Ok, I got that one wrong...
I've upgraded my samba to the latest available : 3.0.28a

Also my smb4k is upgraded to v0.9.3 now

This is the result now:
&lt;<A HREF="http://users.telenet.be/magicbox/samba/snapshot01.png">http://users.telenet.be/magicbox/samba/snapshot01.png</A>&gt;

my network is detected nicely and quickly (my network is called HOME)

Now when I try to browse my network (just click HOME)
I get the following error:
&lt;<A HREF="http://users.telenet.be/magicbox/samba/snapshot02.png">http://users.telenet.be/magicbox/samba/snapshot02.png</A>&gt;


I think this is because smb4k is trying to list the servers without authenticating first...
(ORKA is my synology network server here.
Orka has been elected as the master server because it's always running)

When I now try to enter the options menu I get this error:
&lt;<A HREF="http://users.telenet.be/magicbox/samba/snapshot03.png">http://users.telenet.be/magicbox/samba/snapshot03.png</A>&gt;

Don't worry, I didn't think your mail was rude...
I'm in embedded software myself and I know how important it is to get good tracing, loggings and bug descriptions...

Sorry this took so long to reply.

As you told me you can't reproce it with samba 3.0.28, I kind of gave up on getting this problem fixed...

But at this moment I really need a working version of smb4k.
I need a tool that is able to mount a share locally after the network (wifi) is established.

My samba server is a synology DS107+. This is a small network server running linux&amp;samba.
The current version is samba 3.0.20b.

An user must be authenticated in order to get the list of shares. 
That's what the problem is here I think. My SuSE 10.3 is trying to connect with a guest account and I don't get the shares list...

I don't think it is possible to upgrade the samba server on my synology disk...

Comment:
I investigated this problem further and it seems it only occurs with certain versions of Samba. I cannot reproduce it anymore with Samba 3.0.28. So, this seems not to be an Smb4K bug but an issue with Samba that's unfortunately affecting the performance of Smb4K...

What's your Samba version? Can you upgrade to a newer version and check if the bug persists?

Comment:
As I wrote on bug #011799:
I've selected rap instead of autodetecting in the option&gt;samba&gt;net&gt;protocol hint

now I get my share names, but 1 is still missing &quot;Gentse Dolfijnen&quot; which XP warned me could be to o long (more than 12 characters).

I've not tried with RPC yet.

Comment:
Sorry, I must have overlooked your post...

Have you tried to set the protocol hint in the configuration dialog to &quot;RAP&quot; instead of &quot;Automatic Detection&quot; (see handbook, trouble shooting section)? Especially in AD environments with Windows servers this fixes the issue in most cases. However, with the RAP protocol you are not able to see long share names. 

If &quot;RAP&quot; works you might also want to try to switch to &quot;RPC&quot;. If that works as well, I would be pleased if you could report it.
