<PRE>Bug #10126, was updated on 2007-Jan-26 07:34
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Smb4K
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None
Bug Group: normal
Priority: 5
Submitted by: marsolin
Assigned to : none
Summary: A share appears to mount and then immediately disappears

Details: I'm running Kubuntu Edgy. When I use Smb4K I can browser the network and preview shares correctly, but noe of the mounting methods work.

It looks like the share is starting and then disconnects on its own. It even appears for a moment in the right side of the window. The directory for the share gets created, but it is empty.

I also tried CIFS, but with no luck.

Comment:
IMPORTANT: Please do the mounting/unmounting tests *before* you set the SUID root bit. Else the mounting/unmounting will succeed and you won't get the error messages.

Comment:
To fix this problem, you need to either set the SUID root bit for smbmount/smbumount/mount.cifs/umount.cifs

$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/smbmount
$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/smbumount
$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/mount.cifs
$ sudo chmod +s /path/to/umount.cifs

or enable the super/sudo support in the configuration dialog (Super User -&gt; Actions -&gt; Use super user privileges to mount and unmount shares).

Normally, Smb4K should automatically inform you about this. That it didn't seems to indicate that the error message that's returned by the mount process is different from the ones Smb4K knows. So, would you please do me a favor and try to mount a share from the shell using the following commands:

$ smbmount //HOST/SHARE /mount/point
$ mount.cifs //HOST/SHARE /mount/point

Please replace HOST and SHARE with the appropriate values and choose an existing mount point. Both commands should fail and return an error message. Please report both here. Additionally, I want to ask you to also report the error messages that are returned by smbumount and umount.cifs if you try to unmount a share:

$ smbumount /mount/point
$ umount.cifs /mount/point
