<PRE>Bug #12262, was updated on 2007-Oct-23 23:14
Here is a current snapshot of the bug.

Project: Smb4K
Category: None
Status: Open
Resolution: None

Priority: 5

Summary: Breaks sudo in openSUSE

Details: I use smb4k to mount my NAS drive. I'm just installed openSUSE 10.3 on a test machine. Under settings, the sudo is selected and I also check the &quot;Use super user privileges to mount and unmount shares&quot; option.

Once this has been set, I enter all required passwords. From that point onwards, sudo no longer works giving me the following error: &quot;su return with an error&quot; every time I launch a programme that requires the root password. the su command still works from the console.

When I type sudo from in console, a message informing me that the sudoers file is out of sync. I have also opened the file and it is blank.

The only way I can find to get sudo to work again is by doing a repair-install.

Thank you for the additional information. It helped me to find the problem. It is a limitation in the smb4k_cat utility program. At the moment, smb4k_cat only allows a line to be 255 characters long and forces a line break if the line is longer. That is obviously not enough in some cases... This will be fixed in the next release.

Thanks for reporting this bug.

Hello again.

I managed to figure out how to get access to the sudoers file from the console using visudo command whilst as su. I looked through the lines of code, found line 26, made a note of it and just tried deleting it.

I worked!!!!!!!!

I have full access - for the moment - and can even mount the shares from my NAS drive. I'm going to now try a x-restart followed by a reboot as soon as the updates have been installed.

I'll let you know what happens.

Thanks for all your help. I knew there would be a solution one day. Linux - it's fun and challenging at the same time...

Sorry, forgot the step-by-step:
Installed openSUSE 10.3 as a clean install. Installed smb4k 0.8.5 and updated to 0.8.6, as well as all other available updates.

In smb4k settings I placed a check in &quot;Use super user when mounting and unmount shares&quot;. Applied the changes and from there on I get the above error plus &quot;Su returned with an error&quot; message whenever I tried to run YaST2 from the KDE menu. I can still use the su function via the console.

Thanks for your replay.

I am using version 0.8.6 on KDE 3.5.8 release 21.1 opensuse

Here is the output:

Comment:
I used a fresh installation of OpenSUSE 10.3 and the latest version of Smb4K (i.e. version 0.8.6, self-compiled) in my attempt to reproduce your problem. I did not succeed. The /etc/sudoers file is sane and Smb4K works as expected even after writing several times to the file.

Which version of Smb4K do you use? What exactly did you do (step by step) to get this problem? Could you please provide the output of 

$ ls -la /etc/sudoers

before and after Smb4K wrote to the file? If you get the parse error and the file is *not* empty, could you please also paste its contents here?

Found the error when running the sudo command from console:
&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> sudoers file: syntax error, line 26 &lt;&lt;&lt;
</I>sudo: parse error in /etc/sudoers near line 26

Upon checking the file, it is empty (????)
