Summary: Shares from my NAS don't unfold in the tree view

Details: Hi,

I recently bought an Icy Box IB-NAS900-B external HD, which can - attached to a network - act as a small samba server.
In the network browser, I can see the network, I can see my NAS and I can see the samba shares on my own system. If I click the tree arrow in front of my systems name, all the shares on my system are shown.

If I do the same on my NAS, smb4k tries to open the shares but then nothing happens, the shares don't appear, so I cannot browse them.
If I manually connect to a share on the NAS, everything works fine, but still no unfolding in the tree view.
If I use Konqueror, I can see the shares in the tree view.


I am not sure, but this might be caused by the NAS' hardware. There is no server string, better no readable server string from the samba server.

When I mousover the NAS' name in the tree view, the information pop up shows &quot;Server String: _ &quot; (smb4k 0.8.4), in a former version, it was like looking at undisplayable unicode letters &quot;Server String: *(12 outline Boxes)*&quot;. I suppose, this is a server string in Chinese or Korean language, but I currently don't know how to check that. 

Maybe there is a command line tool to get information about the samba server string?

I tried 'smbtree my_NAS_IP' and it returned the samba tree of my system, the name of my NAS and an error message, which I currently cannot reproduce (samba caching?), but as I tried 'smbtree my_NAS_IP/' (with that slash), it returned both trees of my system and my NAS.

This is why I think, this bug is related to the server string: I think, smb4k runs into exactly the same error message, which stops it from displaying the shares.

If I can provide more info, please let me know.

Comment:
Sorry for the late response.

Smb4K does not use the server string for any of its actions. The &quot;Server String:&quot; entry in the tool tip is only present for information.

To be able to find out what the problem is, I'd like to know whether Smb4K is able to detect the workgroup, name and IP address of your ICY box correctly? Have you tried to query the Samba server from the terminal and retrieve the list of shares? Which command did you use and what was the output?

Finally, may I ask you to run the following commands from the terminal:

$ net rpc share -l -S &lt;name of your NAS&gt; -w &lt;your NAS' workgroup&gt; -I &lt;IP address of your NAS&gt; -U &lt;your login&gt;

$ net rap share -l -S &lt;name of your NAS&gt; -w &lt;your NAS' workgroup&gt; -I &lt;IP address of your NAS&gt; -U &lt;your login&gt;

What's the output?
